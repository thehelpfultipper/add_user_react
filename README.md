# React: Add User App

**✨ Objective ✨** 
<br>
Build a simple application that allows a user to add a name and age to a list. If there is an error in either entry, a modal will pop up to notify the user.

Since this is my first official React project, I’ll be breaking it into parts touching on:

- creating components with JSX
- managing state across components
- adding styles to React components
- defining logic in components
- passing data across components
